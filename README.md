`Schediazo` is a vector drawing package in Python which writes to `SVG` files.  There are other SVG writers/readers, for example ![Orsinium-labs/svg.py](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg.py) but I already had my own SVG code and routines that did additional vector drawing tasks, for example to align drawing objects or to fit Bezier curves (not yet included) so this repo exists mainly for my own use.  I've also used it as an exercise in type hinting and multiple inheritance.

The word `Schediazo` is related to the Greek word for drawing.
